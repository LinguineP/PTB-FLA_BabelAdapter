This folder contains the script and config file to install a service in a raspberry
named 'swarm' that creates and enables the simple use case as a service.

The configuration script must be executed as sudo, it assumes bash, and it has two
arguments the first is mandadory and the second is optional:

1. The username underwhich this repository was cloned. The repository must be cloned
to the root of the home directory of the user.
2. A flag with value either 'leader' or 'follower', with default value 'follower'. 
Only the first node should be installed with the tag leager as this will disable the
process to conduct multicast discovery for a contact to introuce this node to the
swarm. All other nodes should be follower, that will enable discovery of a contact
point through multicast.

Examples of usage:

Leader:

sudo ./install.sh jleitao leader

Follower:

sudo ./install.sh jleitao

There is also a script to uninstall the service (if it exists) that must be executed
as root. This script does not take any arguments.

Example of usage:

sudo ./uninstall.sh
